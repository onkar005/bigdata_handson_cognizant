PERFORM THE FOLLOWING FIRST:

create 2 seperate directories by name emp,dept and put emp.txt into emp, dept.txt into dept.

1.
hdfs dfs -mkdir emp
hdfs dfs -put /home/training/Desktop/prac_hive/payroll/emp.txt emp


hdfs dfs -mkdir dept
hdfs dfs -put /home/training/Desktop/prac_hive/payroll/dept.txt dept


_____________________________________________________________________

2. Create metastore tables for emp, and dept.

launch beeline:

beeline -u jdbc:hive2://localhost:10000/default -n training

create external table emp(empno int,ename string,job string,mgr int,hiredate string,salary int,comm int,deptno int)
row format delimited
fields terminated by '/'
location '/user/training/emp';

describe emp;

describe formatted emp;

select * from emp;

__________________________________________

create external table dept(deptno int,dname string,loc string)
row format delimited
fields terminated by ','
location '/user/training/dept';

select * from dept;

____________________________________________

Now we will create salgrade table in other way.

check : hdfs dfs -ls /user/training (check whether there is a directory by name salgrade or not, it must not be there).


at beeline (launch if not)

create external table salgrade(grade int,losal int,hisal int)
row format delimited
fields terminated by ','
location '/user/training/salgrade';

Now again check hdfs dfs -ls /user/training (this time you will find salgrade directory automatically created)

Now query: select * from salgrade;

Now: hdfs dfs -put /home/training/Desktop/prac_hive/payroll/salgrade.txt /user/training/salgrade

select * from salgrade;

_________________________________________________________________________________________________


3. Find out employees with salary greater than 2000 from emp.

select * from emp where salary > 2000;



4. Filter employees whose name starts with 'A'

select * from emp where ename like 'A%';

6. Filter employees whose name starts with second character as 'A' in continuation to above.

select * from emp where ename like '_A%';

7. Filter employees who belongs to department number 20 and with job 'CLERK'

select * from emp where deptno=20 and job='CLERK';


8. Display empno,ename, salary,deptno and department name using join.

select e.empno,e.ename,e.salary,e.deptno,d.dname from emp e join dept d on e.deptno=d.deptno;

9. Find out department wise total sum of salaries of all employees;

select deptno,sum(salary) from emp group by deptno;

10. Display ename,sal and his annual salary and print in desc order of annual salaries.

select ename,salary,salary*12 as annsal from emp order by salary*12 desc;
